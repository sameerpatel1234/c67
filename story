the bear and the two friends

one upon a time there were two friends walking through the forest.
they knew that anything dangerous can happen to them at any time in thr forest.
so thay promesed each other that taey would remain reunited in any case of danger.

sudenly,they saw a larg bear apporiching them .
one of the friends at once climbed a near by tree.
but the other one didnt know how to climb.
so being led by his common sense he layed down on the ground breathless.
pretending to be a dead man.

the bear cam near the man laying on the ground.
it smeled in his ears and slowly left he place.
beacuse the bear dose not touch the dead creatures.
now the friend on the tree came down and asked his frend on the garound.
friend what did the bear tell in your ear .
the other briend the bear advise me not to belive a false friend
